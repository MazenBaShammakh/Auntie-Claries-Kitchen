Introduction
Aunty Claire`s kitchen is an online homemade food ordering website.The site visitors can view the daily menu and place an order. Aunty Claire is a person who cooks daily fresh homemade healthy food to the customers. The food is then either sent to the customer by Grab, or the customer can come and collect it when it's ready. 






Team
Group Contributions
Each of the team members prepared 4 web pages for the progress presentation as shown in Table 1. 


Future enhancement 
At the moment, the website is still static pages only. We are planning to make it more interactive by linking it to the database through jQuery and ajax. The admin will be able to add, modify, and remove from the menu as wished. The login system will be activated as well.
